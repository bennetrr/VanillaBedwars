# Bedwars

## What is Bedwars?
Bedwars is a minigame in Minecraft. It's for example known from Hypixel, but you can play it in a lot of variations on a lot of servers. The goal is to be the last surviving team. Each team has a bed, you and your teammates can respawn on death when the bed has not yet been broken by another team. To win, you have to break the other teams beds and kill them, and you have to protect your bed and your teammates. You can buy blocks, tools and other items with materials that spawn on some places on the map.

## About this bedwars
This Bedwars is very much inspired by Hypixel's Bedwars. The map (by B3Crazy) consists of several islands. On the islands you can spawn the 4 materials Iron, Gold, Diamonds and Emeralds. With these materials, you can buy blocks, tools, traps, upgrades and other items. It's build using java and the Paper API for Minecraft 1.17.1.
